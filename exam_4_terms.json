    "Reaming": "Enlarging a hole after a smaller diameter drill has pre-drilled a hole. This generally leads to a better surface finish as well.",
    "Broaching": "Removing material with a special tool called a broach, which has teeth and is the shape the section of the part for intended removal. This process removes material with a pushing or pulling motion using the teeth on the tool. This is generally used for special slot shapes.",
    "Cutting fluids": "Usually a special type of oil used to remove heat from the part caused by friction of the cutting tool and the workpiece.",
    "Slab milling": "Spindle rotation is parallel to the surface of the part. Spinning against the part like a wheel, taking off material and usually used to flatten parts.",
    "CAD": "Computer Aided Design. Used for rapid prototyping to create a computer model of a part which can then be processed by a computer in various manufacturing processes.",
    "Rapid prototyping": "The idea of turning a design in CAD into a real part quickly in moderate to high volumes. Commonly used for testing and or demonstrating usage before a part is mass produced.",
    "Rapid casting": "A rapid prototyping technique that uses methods like 3D printing to create molds which can then be quickly casted.",
    "Subtractive processes": "Any process that requires removing material from a stock material. This includes milling and lathing.",

    "Fused deposition modeling": "This process uses thermoplastic filament (thin round plastic, like wire) extruded from a print head to layer plastic material to create a part.",

    "Laminated objects method": "Basically gluing thin materials like paper or foils that are cut into a layer shape together to make a 3D object. This can be done with low cost and quickly but is not very strong.",
    "Investment casting wax patterns": "Coating a wax pattern in a final mold material and then melting the wax away to reveal just the mold, which can then be used to cast parts.",
